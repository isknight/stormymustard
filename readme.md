Stormy Mustard is a simple app that I am hacking together for https://github.com/breedx2/

It uses a toy recurrent-ish neural network to generate unique sound/noise combinations, and allows a user to hone in/cull different A.I. models with the goal of being able to create interesting noise.

This was a quick weekend hackjob that I'll continue to contribute to periodically.

## Setup instructions:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:isknight/stormymustard.git
$ cd stormymustard
$ npm install bower && \
  cd stormymustard/public && \
  ../../node_modules/bower/bin/bower install
```

After that:
* open `public/stormymustard.html` in your browser
* turn up your volume
* hear interesting sounds generated by neural nets

## Controls:

left/right arrow, move selector.

space, start/stop entity making noise.

m, move currently selected entity to the far left, repopulate the rest of them with mutated derivatives.
